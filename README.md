## Contact Manager

```
This project was assigned to our group of 6 as an introduction to full stack software developement. 

Users can go to the webpage, login with their credentials, and access a list of contacts from a database.
The user can add, create, delete, and update their contacts on the contact list page.

You can see the application live at https://contact-manager-group1.herokuapp.com/.
